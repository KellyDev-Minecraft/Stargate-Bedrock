## user should always come out of the center of the frame from the sign facing side of the portal [DONE]

## rename the Stargate Manual to Stargate Casting Guide and make a new recipe to make the book [DONE]

## change image for the book to use the Stargate_RP/texture/items/casting_guide.png [DONE]

## Add a new feature to the book that will alow the user to summon an auto build of the selected gate to the on the next block selected from bottom left. this new feature costs xp. the about of xp should scail based on the rarity of the materials to build the gate in the local area, max cost should be 30

## get rid of dialing ui and replace it with just setting the text of the sign to the show a selected address e.g. 
"-Gate1-
<address1>
address2
address3"
seeing as the sign can only have 4 lines the selected address in the <> should be the one that is being dialed when the button is pressed.
